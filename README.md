# Patient-Triage-System


• Implemented priority queue data structure in Java using max-heap to mimic an automated patient triage system,
which allows hospitals to admit patients based on either age or condition severity (levels 1-4)

• Maximized space efficiency by leveraging array-based allocation to store heap; developed algorithm to automatically
maintain heap invariant property
